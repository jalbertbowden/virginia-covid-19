# [ACRJ COVID-19 Dataset](https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/thomas-jefferson/tjhd-covid-19-data-portal/)  

ACRJ COVID-19 dataset.
It is not clear what ACRJ stands for; [ACRJ website]() calls it the Albemarle Charlottesville Regional Jail, while the Thomas Jefferson Health District (TJHD) data portal refers to it as the Albemarle County Regional Jail.  
Probably the former, but the question remains.

x is a note, but not an asterisk because markdown is annoying.  
x = 2020-05-26 is not a referenceable date, however it is the first date captured in the Wayback Machine that includes the dataset note and description.
