*,"The first inmate who tested positive was asymptomatic, was housed in a quarantine block and has since received a negative COVID-19 test and completed a 14-day quarantine. This is no longer an active case. The other two COVID-positive inmates were admitted into the jail (having been tested prior to their arrests) and have been released from custody. They were housed separate from general population."
