Note,Description
*,"Of the 63 inmates who were tested, 26 were housed in a 14-day quarantine block either because they were new admits or had been out of the jail, such as for a medical appointment or court in another jurisdiction. The purpose of the 14-day quarantine is to monitor for symptoms and prevent bringing COVID-19 into general population. Any inmate with COVID-19 symptoms is housed in Medical Isolation and tested if they meet the Virginia Department of Health criteria."
**,The first inmate who tested positive was asymptomatic and has since received a negative COVID-19 test and completed a 14-day quarantine as a precaution. This is no longer considered an active case. Another COVID-positive inmate was admitted into the jail (having been tested prior to his arrest) in mid-July and was released after one night. The third was also tested positive prior to being admitted to the jail and is housed separate from general population.
