Report Description,"Previous coverage reports initially focused on specific fields, primarily around remdesivir allocation, and also focused on a subset of priority hospitals. The Secretary's Guidance for Hospital Reporting and FAQ and the new CMS Interim Final Rule with Comment Period (IFC) require all hospitals who are licensed to provide 24 hour care to report all of the mandatory non-supply fields seven days a week within 1 business day of the reporting date (except for psychiatric and rehabilitation facilities who must report weekly). This includes short term, long term, critical access, childrens, Medicaid only short term, Medicaid only childrens,  Distinct Part Psychiatric Hospital, and Medicaid only long term hospitals and refers to items 1 - 24 in the Guidance for Hospital Reporting and FAQ. Hospitals are only required to report supply related fields (items 26, 27, 29, 30, 31) on Wednesdays. 

Psychiatric, Rehabilitation, Medicaid only Childrens Psychiatric, Medicaid only Psychiatric, and Medicaid only Rehabilitation hospitals are required to report all mandatory fields on Wednesdays only. This refers to items 1 - 24, 26, 27, 29, 30, and 31 in the FAQ. 

This Hospital Data Coverage Report covers the last week from Friday to Thursday and lists each hospital in the state, the percentage of mandatory fields reported, the number of days reported at 100%, whether a hospital is required to report on Wednesdays only, and lists each required field with the number of days that specific field was reported for the week. For facilities that are only required to report once a week, the overall count of days at 100% are shown as 7 if reported successfully for Wednesday and 0 otherwise. Individual fields are shown as Yes if reported successfully on Wednesday and No otherwise. To support identification of missing fields, cells showing required fields are shaded as follows: Fields reported 0-3 times are shaded red, fields reported 4-6 times are shaded yellow. Fields that are only required to be reported on Wednesdays are listed as Yes/No indicating if the fields was reported as required. All No indicators are shaded red. We appreciate your feedback on this collaborative effort to improve COVID-19 hospital reporting for the pandemic response. Please let us know of any discrepancies or issues you find in the report by emailing protect-servicedesk@hhs.gov"
