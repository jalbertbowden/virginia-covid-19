COVID-19 State Profile Report - Virginia  
The State Profile Report (SPR) is generated by the Data Strategy and Execution Workgroup in the Joint Coordination Cell, in collaboration with the White House. It is managed by an interagency team with representatives from multiple agencies and offices (including the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the HHS Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, and the Indian Health Service). The SPR provides easily interpretable information on key indicators for each state, down to the county level.

It is a weekly snapshot in time that:
- Focuses on recent outcomes in the last seven days and changes relative to the month prior
- Provides additional contextual information at the county level for each state, and includes national level information
- Supports rapid visual interpretation of results with color thresholds
