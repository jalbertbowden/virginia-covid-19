### [CDC Interim Guidance for Rapid Antigen Testing for SARS-CoV-2](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/resources/antigen-tests-guidelines.html)  
Antigen tests are commonly used in the diagnosis of respiratory infections. To date, the FDA has granted emergency use authorization (EUA) for four antigen tests that can identify SARS-CoV-2. Antigen tests are relatively inexpensive and can be used at the point-of-care.  The currently authorized devices return results in approximately 15 minutes.  Antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2 are generally less sensitive than molecular tests that detect nucleic acid and RT-PCR remains the “gold standard” for detection of SARS-CoV-2.  It may be necessary to confirm a negative rapid antigen test result with a molecular test, especially if clinical suspicion is high.  Rapid antigen  tests may be helpful in the following scenarios:
1. As a diagnostic test to identify someone in the early stages of infection when viral load is generally highest or to test someone with known exposure to a person with confirmed COVID-19.
2. As a screening test for individuals in high-risk congregate settings in which repeat testing could quickly identify persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection to inform infection prevention and control measures.
3. Specific guidance exists for using [point-of-care antigen tests in nursing homes](https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/182/2020/08/VDH-Interim-Point-of-Care-Antigen-Testing-Recommendations-for-Nursing-Homes.pdf)

[VDH Updated Healthcare Provider Algorithms for Molecular and Antigen Testing](https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/182/2020/05/COVID-19-Testing-Algorithm.pdf)  
VDH updated the algorithm for COVID-19 molecular testing and added an algorithm for COVID-19 antigen testing to assist healthcare personnel navigate testing options, considerations, and what recommendations to provide based on the results.  

### [VDH Updated Guidance for COVID-19 Testing](https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/health-professionals/vdh-updated-guidance-on-testing-for-covid-19/)  
VDH released updated guidance for COVID-19 testing on September 14, 2020.  The guidance provides recommendations on testing prioritization through public health and through private and commercial laboratories.  Public health molecular testing continues to be prioritized for outbreak investigations, public health surveillance, community testing events organized by the local health department, testing for un- or under-insured persons with COVID-19 symptoms, and other special situations approved by the local health department.  The use of private/commercial laboratories for testing should be prioritized for other scenarios.

### [Public Health Prioritization of Point Prevalence Surveys](https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/182/2020/08/VDH_PPS_Priorization_DCM-H1.pdf)  

To meet the demand for conducting point prevalence surveys (PPS) in high-risk settings while recognizing limitations in testing capacity, VDH is prioritizing PPS by setting with baseline PPS prioritized in nursing homes and assisted living facilities, and PPS in response to outbreaks in congregate settings (including correctional facilities) and critical infrastructure workplaces.  If an outbreak is confirmed but the congregate setting does not meet priority criteria for public health PPS, the facility could perform a PPS using a private lab.  [For a list of private labs, please visit here](https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/182/2020/04/SARS-COV-2-Testing-Capabilities-Commercial-Labs.pdf).  Decisions to pursue a public health supported PPS should be made in consultation with the local health department (LHD).  The congregate setting will need to be heavily involved in the PPS process even if the LHD is collaborating.

### [VDH Updated Healthcare Provider Algorithms for Molecular and Antigen Testing](https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/182/2020/05/COVID-19-Testing-Algorithm.pdf)

VDH updated the algorithm for COVID-19 molecular testing and added an algorithm for COVID-19 antigen testing to assist healthcare personnel navigate testing options, considerations, and what recommendations to provide based on the results.

### [VDH Algorithm for Evaluating a Child with COVID-19 Symptoms or Exposure](https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/182/2020/08/Evaluating-Symptoms-in-a-Child.pdf)  
VDH released a new [algorithm](https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/182/2020/08/Evaluating-Symptoms-in-a-Child.pdf) to assist parents and guardians, schools and childcare facilities, and healthcare providers for when a child should be excluded from the facility, when care and further evaluation for COVID-19 should be pursued, and when the child can return to the school or childcare facility. A revised version is under development.
