This dataset includes the cumulative (total) number of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths for each health district in Virginia by report date and by age group. This dataset was first published on March 29, 2020.

When you download the data set, the dates will be sorted in ascending order, meaning that the earliest date will be at the top. To see data for the most recent date, please scroll down to the bottom of the data set. The Virginia Department of Healthâ€™s Thomas Jefferson Health District (TJHD) will be renamed to Blue Ridge Health District (BRHD), effective January 2021.
