## About KFF  

KFF is a non-profit organization focusing on national health issues, as well as the U.S. role in global health policy. KFF develops and runs its own policy analysis, journalism and communications programs, sometimes in partnership with major news organizations.

KFF serves as a non-partisan source of facts, analysis and journalism for policymakers, the media, the health policy community and the public. Our product is information, always provided free of charge — from the most sophisticated policy research, to basic facts and numbers, to in-depth health policy news coverage provided by our news service, [KHN](https://khn.org/), to information young people can use to improve their health or the general public can use to understand health insurance.

The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation was established in 1948, but it was completely remade in 1991, under the leadership of CEO Drew Altman. We have not changed our name, but nowadays refer to ourselves simply as KFF — our legal name can cause occasional confusion because we are neither a foundation, a family foundation, nor are we associated with Kaiser Permanente. We keep the name to honor the legacy of our original benefactor, the great industrialist Henry J. Kaiser, whose motto “find a need and fill it,” we have adapted into our motto: “Filling the need for trusted information on national health issues.”

KFF is not associated with Kaiser Permanente.
