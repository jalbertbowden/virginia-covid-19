# COVID-19 in Virginia Hospitals  

[VHHA](https://www.vhha.com/) launched the COVID-19 in Virginia Hospitals Dashboard with data on patients hospitalized, ventilator usage, bed availability, and supply status data point on 2020-04-06.  
2020-04-13 COVID-19 in Virginia Hospitals Dashboard was updated to show hospital discharge statistics.  

Original dataset files are PDF and PNG; converted to CSV/JSON and provided here.  
Requests to VHHA asking for Tableau's data export option to be turned on where never responded to.  
Unfortunately, the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/) could not be used for archiving this dataset, as Tableau does not play nicely with others.  
These dashboards are bare minimum, and [archive.is](https://archive.is/) was built for JavaScript-heavy documents, and can handle the most basic Tableau visualization.
